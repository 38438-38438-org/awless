# Why awless

`awless` will help you achieve your goals without leaving your terminal:

- run frequent actions by using simple commands
- get nice and readable output (for humans) that machine know how to parse too
- explore and query your infrastructure and cloud resources, even **offline**
- ensure smart defaults & security best practices
- write and run powerful templates (see [`awless` templates](https://github.com/wallix/awless/wiki/Templates))
- connect to your instances easily

# Install

</p>

- Clear and easy listing of multi-region cloud resources (subnets, instances, groups, users, etc.) on AWS EC2, IAM and S3: `awless list`
- Output formats either human (Markdown-compatible tables, trees) or machine readable (csv, tsv, json, ...): `--format`
- Listing can be filtered via *resource properties* or *resources tags* 
- Explore a resource given only an *id*, name or arn (properties, relations, dependencies, ...): `awless show`
- Creation, update and deletion (CRUD) of cloud resources and complex infrastructure with smart defaults and sound autocomplete through powerful awless templates: `awless run my-awless-templates/create_my_infra.txt`
- Powerful CRUD CLI one-liner (integrated in the awless templating engine) with: `awless create instance ...`, `awless create vpc ...`, `awless attach policy ...`
- Leveraging AWS `userdata` to provision instance on creation from remote (i.e http) or local scripts: `awless create instance userdata=http://...` 
- Easy reporting of all the CLI template executions: `awless log`
- Revert of executed templates and resources creation: `awless revert`
- Clean and simple ssh to instances: `awless ssh`
- Resolve public images dynamically (i.e. independant of the region specific AMI id): `awless search images canonical:ubuntu:xenial --id-only`
- Aliasing of resources through their natural name so you don't have to always use cryptic ids that are impossible to remember
- Inspectors are small CLI utilities to run analysis on your cloud resources graphs: `awless inspect`
- Manual sync mode to fetch & store resources locally. Then query & inspect your cloud offline: `awless sync`
- CLI autocompletion for Unix/Linux's bash and zsh `awless completion`
